# Refactoring test in C#

## Description

Please refactor the CustomerService class and more specifically its AddCustomer method. Assume that the code is sound in terms of business logic and only focus on applying clean code principles. Keep in mind acronyms such as SOLID, KISS, DRY and YAGNI and adding unit tests where appropriate.

We recommend spending between one to two hours on this test. If you still have things you can improve afterwards, please write them down and we will take them into account. We are aware that the validation logic isn't perfect but we do not expect you to fix that or make it more comprehensive.

Please feel free to use any online resources that you think might help you (StackOverflow, Google, etc.)

## Limitations

You can change anything in the App project except for where indicated by the comments. For example, the CustomerDataAccess class and its AddCustomer method - both the class and the method NEED to stay static.

## For extra credit (optional)

Assume that this codebase is part of a greater system and any non-backwards compatible change will break the system.

## Summary

Your solution MUST build and all the tests MUST pass. We suggest that you try downloading your own zip file - extracting, compiling and running tests in your Downloads directory. Please do not send us the zip file itself but rather send us a link to a file sharing site (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, WeTransfer, etc.)

In the discussion following we will expect you to explain the changes you have made so far and what your next steps would be.
